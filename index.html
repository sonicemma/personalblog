            <p>I am currently a student at Lambda School. Lambda school is an online, immersive course that promises to make you a good developer within 9 months. I signed up for this around August of 2019, but wasn't too sure if I wanted to take the risk. What makes it unique is that it lets you sign an income share agreement, which only takes your money once you get a job paying over $50,000. I thought this was too good to be true, so I took awhile to think about it. Eventually I went through with it, and I began classes in early January. I am really glad I did, but this isn't a blog about Lambda. It's a blog about me. I got an idea to start a blog from my friend Jacob, who's ideas I will shamelessly copy as originality is dead.<br>
            <br>
            Ever since I was a teenager, I've always wanted to program. I've dabbled in various other programming languages before dedicating myself on Javascript. Lua, C++, C#, and Python. To me, programming was truely special. It allowed you to make things from almost literally nothing and engage with other people in a meaningful way. The Internet revolutionized how we communicate and interact with the world. Programmers are the architect of this new world. I was always inspired, but before Lambda, could never really focus hard enough on achieving my goals. I have ADD, and I really needed this guidance to push myself.
            <br><br>
            I hope to one day be a very good programmer. That's been my dream for the longest time. I want to have a nice job, get enough money that I won't have to worry, and be respected in my field. I've never had a career before, so the idea is incredibly daunting and seems almost out of reach. I know that if I push myself hard, I can achieve it, but the thought of it scares me. I am so close to achieving my dreams, yet so far. The wait is agonizing, but I'm enjoying the journey. I've learned so much the past two months. I know that in time, I will know more and truly be able to capture what I've always wanted.
